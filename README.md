This repository contains the source code and experimental results for a Unicode compressor. For details of my approach, see the documentation file `Dissertation.pdf'. The directory structure is:

* src - my source code.
* steinruecken - source code from my collaborator Christian Steinruecken, which the above source code depends on.;
* experiments - raw data from my experiments.
* ext - source code for other compressors. This is not used directly by my source code, but I do use them for some of my experiemnts.

Source code in src/ that were developed wholly by myself are released under the GPL license. This does *not* apply to files derived from the codebase in steinruecken/. The license is clearly specified in the header of each file.
