cmix version 9
http://www.byronknoll.com/cmix.html
Released by Byron Knoll on April 8, 2016.
cmix is free software distributed under the GNU General Public License.

In Linux or OS X, use "make" to compile cmix using g++. In Windows, cmix can be compiled with MinGW (http://nuwen.net/mingw.html) or Cygwin (https://www.cygwin.com).

cmix can only compress/decompress single files. To compress multiple files or directories, create an archive file using "tar" (or some similar tool).

For some files, preprocessing using "precomp" may improve compression: https://github.com/schnaader/precomp-cpp

Compiling with "-Ofast -march=native" will have the best performance, but this can also cause compression results to vary slightly between different computers. Compile with "-O3" to improve compatibility between computers.
